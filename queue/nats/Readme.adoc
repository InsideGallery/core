= NATS High-Level Wrapper &amp; Proxy for Golang

== Overview

This repository provides a high-level wrapper for the https://github.com/nats-io/nats.go[official NATS Go client], enabling scalable and efficient message processing. It dynamically adjusts the number of goroutines to optimize performance by increasing worker count under load and reducing idle workers automatically.

Additionally, the repository includes a proxy implementation that balances messages between pods based on a given rule, ensuring efficient distribution across multiple instances.

== Features

* *Automatic Scaling of Workers:* Adjusts goroutine count based on message load.
* *High-Level API:* Simplifies integration with NATS Core.
* *Proxy Implementation:* Balances messages across pods based on predefined rules.
* *Efficient Resource Utilization:* Reduces idle workers to conserve CPU and memory.
* *Resilient and Fault-Tolerant:* Designed for high availability in distributed environments.
